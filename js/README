/js

Javascript files.
  - For each clear purpose there should be maintained an individual file.
  - For performance reason the individual files should be glued together via Jekyll, BUT distinguished in two files:
    - Scripts to run BEFORE parsing content
      - those that do not change DOM
      - loaded in HTML HEAD
    - Scripts to run AFTER parsing content
      - those that DO change DOM
      - loaded at the end of HTML BODY
  - Rich commenting should be done via Jekyll Tags
    - ... makes only sense if scripts are glued by Jekyll, see above
